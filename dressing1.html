        <p class="description">
            Maharashtrian dressing reflects the state's cultural heritage, with men traditionally wearing the Dhoti or Dhotar paired with a Kurta or Pheta (turban). Women typically wear the Nauvari Saree, a nine-yard saree draped in a unique style that allows freedom of movement. The attire is often complemented by traditional jewelry, including the Nath (nose ring), Mundavalya (forehead ornament), and green glass bangles, especially worn during weddings and festivals. This traditional dressing symbolizes the rich cultural identity of Maharashtra.
