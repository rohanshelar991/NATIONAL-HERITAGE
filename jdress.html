        <p class="description">
            Jammu and Kashmir's traditional attire is a reflection of its rich cultural heritage, deeply influenced by the region's climate and history. The most iconic garment is the **Pheran**, a long robe worn by both men and women, designed to keep warm in the cold climate. Women often pair the Pheran with **Taranga**, a traditional headdress, while men may wear it with a skullcap or a turban. These garments are not just clothing but symbols of Jammu and Kashmir's unique cultural identity and craftsmanship.
