        <p class="description">
            Maharashtrian cuisine is a rich tapestry of flavors, combining spicy, tangy, and sweet elements. Staple foods include rice, bhakri (flatbread), and lentils. Popular dishes like Pav Bhaji (spicy mashed vegetables with buttered bread), Vada Pav (spicy potato fritter in a bread bun), and Misal Pav (a spicy curry with lentils, topped with farsan and served with bread) reflect the vibrant street food culture. Traditional meals often include Puran Poli (sweet flatbread stuffed with lentil and jaggery), Bharli Vangi (stuffed eggplant), and Amti (a tangy-sweet lentil curry), showcasing the state's diverse culinary heritage. Maharashtrian food also emphasizes the use of coconut, peanuts, and kokum, adding distinct regional flavors to the dishes.
