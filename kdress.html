        <p class="description">
            Kerala's traditional attire is a reflection of its rich cultural heritage. The most iconic garment is the Kasavu Saree, worn by women, especially during festivals like Onam. It is known for its elegant white color and golden border. Men traditionally wear the Mundu, a garment similar to a dhoti, often paired with a shirt or a traditional Kurta. These garments are not just clothing but symbols of Kerala's deep-rooted traditions and simplicity.
